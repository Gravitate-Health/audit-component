    # IMPORTANT:
    #   Note that this include is mandatory as it carries logrotate parameters
    #   to automatically generated temporary logrotate conf file that is used to
    #   rotate logsignature files. NONE of the parameters described here will
    #   be available in automatically generated script. 
    include /etc/logrotate-rsyslog-ksi-common.conf

    # This include defines two scripts and generates temporary logrotate conf
    # for integrated log signatures. Actual rotation of log signature files is
    # done here.
    #   o postrotate - renames log signature parts file directory that matches
    #                  the pattern (e.g /var/log/network-1.log.logsig.parts).
    #   o lastaction - After all log files and log signature parts files are
    #                  renamed -HUP is sent to rsyslog to close the files.
    #                  At next logksi integrate is called to get final log
    #                  signatures. After integration another call to logrotate
    #                  is called to rotate generated logsignature files.
